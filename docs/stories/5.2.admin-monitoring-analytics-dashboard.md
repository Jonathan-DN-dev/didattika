## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for analytics data flow and dashboard functionality using Playwright
- Test data accuracy, visualization rendering, and export functionality
- Test coverage should include metrics calculation, real-time updates, and report generation
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Teacher Analytics (Stories 1.2, 3.2):**
- Analytics infrastructure and visualization patterns are established
- User engagement tracking mechanisms are available
- Export functionality patterns are implemented
