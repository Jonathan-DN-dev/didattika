## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for complete tagging workflow using Playwright
- Test AI tag generation with sample academic documents
- Test coverage should include tag extraction, visualization, and navigation
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory
