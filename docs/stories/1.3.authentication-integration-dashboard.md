# Story 1.3: Authentication Integration with Dashboard ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** student,
**I want** to be redirected to a personalized dashboard after logging in that integrates with the chat interface,
**so that** I can seamlessly access all platform features from a centralized location with proper authentication context.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Student is redirected to dashboard after successful login
2. Dashboard displays user profile information and session status
3. Dashboard provides navigation to chat interface while maintaining authentication
4. Dashboard shows authentication state and provides logout functionality
5. Protected routes ensure only authenticated users can access dashboard and chat
6. Dashboard layout is responsive and follows the established design system
7. Session management handles token refresh and expiration gracefully
8. Chat interface is properly integrated into the dashboard workflow

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for complete authentication-to-dashboard flow using Playwright
- Test coverage should include authentication state changes, route protection, and component integration
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1 (Student Registration and Login):**
- Authentication infrastructure with Supabase is established
- AuthProvider context pattern is available for state management
- Protected route wrapper components are implemented
- JWT token handling and session management is in place
- Form validation patterns using React Hook Form are established

**From Story 1.2 (Basic AI Chat Interface):**
- Chat interface components are designed and ready for integration
- ChatProvider for message state management is available
- OpenAI API integration patterns are established
- Error handling and loading states for async operations are implemented
- User context patterns for personalized AI responses are defined

### Data Models
**User Profile Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Users table in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, email, password_hash, user_type (student/teacher), created_at, updated_at
- Managed through Supabase authentication system
- Integration with existing authentication from Story 1.1

**Session Management:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- JWT tokens for session management
- Token refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions
- Session persistence across browser refreshes
- Automatic logout on token expiration

### API Specifications
**Dashboard Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- GET /api/dashboard - Get dashboard data for authenticated user
- GET /auth/me - Get current user profile (existing from Story 1.1)
- POST /auth/logout - User logout with token cleanup (existing from Story 1.1)
- Integration with existing authentication endpoints from Story 1.1

**Chat Integration:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- Chat endpoints from Story 1.2 require authenticated user context
- User ID must be passed to chat API for personalized responses
- Session management between dashboard and chat components

### Component Specifications
**UI Components Required:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- Dashboard layout component with responsive design
- Dashboard header with user profile and logout functionality
- Navigation sidebar/menu using Radix UI components
- Integration container for chat interface components
- Loading and error state components for dashboard sections
- TailwindCSS styling following existing design system from Stories 1.1 and 1.2

### File Locations
**Based on project structure:**
- Dashboard page: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (existing structure observed)
- Dashboard components: `components/Dashboard/`
- Dashboard layout: `components/Dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Dashboard content: `components/Dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` (existing observed)
- Navigation components: `components/Dashboard/Navigation.tsx`
- Integration with existing Auth components in `components/Auth/`
- Integration with existing Chat components in `components/Chat/`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS (consistent with Stories 1.1, 1.2)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth (established in Story 1.1)
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase (established in Story 1.1)
- TypeScript for type safety (consistent with project standards)
- Follow existing component patterns using CVA and Radix UI

**Integration Requirements:**
- Must seamlessly integrate authentication from Story 1.1
- Must properly embed chat interface from Story 1.2
- Responsive design following established TailwindCSS patterns
- Component composition using established AuthProvider and ChatProvider patterns

**Performance Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#requisiti-non-funzionali]
- Dashboard load time < 2s after authentication
- Smooth transitions between authentication and dashboard
- Optimized component loading with proper loading states
- Session state management without unnecessary API calls

**Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
- Protected route implementation preventing unauthorized access
- Secure token handling and storage
- Proper session cleanup on logout
- Authentication state validation on dashboard load
- GDPR compliance for user data display
