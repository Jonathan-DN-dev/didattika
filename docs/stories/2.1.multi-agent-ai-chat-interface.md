# Story 2.1: Multi-agent AI Chat Interface ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to ask questions to an AI assistant and receive clear, coherent responses,
**so that** I can get educational support and assistance with my learning materials.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can access AI chat interface after successful authentication
2. User can send text messages to the AI and receive relevant responses
3. AI responses are coherent, contextual, and educationally focused
4. Chat interface displays messages in a clear, readable conversation format
5. Chat maintains conversation context throughout the session
6. AI responses are generated using OpenAI API with educational prompts
7. System handles API errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
8. Chat interface includes typing indicators and loading states
9. User can start new conversations and continue existing ones

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for complete AI chat flow using Playwright
- Mock OpenAI API responses for consistent testing
- Test coverage should include message handling, error states, and context management
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights

- User context and protected routes are available
- TailwindCSS design system and component patterns are established

**From Story 1.2 (Basic AI Chat Interface):**
- Basic chat interface components are implemented
- Chat provider for state management is available
- Initial OpenAI API integration patterns are established
- Error handling and loading states are implemented

**From Story 1.3 (Authentication Integration with Dashboard):**
- Dashboard integration patterns are established
- User session management is implemented
- Navigation and layout components are available

### Data Models
**Conversation Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Conversazioni table in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, user_id, agent_type, title, context, created_at, updated_at
- Enhanced with agent_type field for multi-agent support
- Integration with existing Users table

**Message Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Messages table for conversation history
- Fields: id, conversation_id, sender_type, content, timestamp, metadata
- Support for user and AI message types
- Conversation threading and context preservation

### API Specifications
**Enhanced AI Chat Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- POST /api/chat/message - Send message and get AI response with agent selection
- GET /api/chat/conversations - List user's conversations with metadata
- POST /api/chat/conversations - Create new conversation with agent type
- GET /api/chat/conversations/:id - Get conversation history with messages
- DELETE /api/chat/conversations/:id - Delete conversation and messages

**OpenAI Integration Enhancement:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- Provider: OpenAI (GPT-4 / GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Orchestration: Langroid for advanced conversation management
- Educational prompt engineering with contextual responses
- Multi-turn conversation support with memory
- Cost optimization through prompt engineering and caching

### Component Specifications
**Enhanced UI Components:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- Enhanced ChatInterface component with multi-agent support
- ConversationList component for managing multiple conversations
- MessageBubble components with enhanced formatting and metadata
- TypingIndicator with agent-specific animations
- ChatInput component with enhanced features (attachments, formatting)
- ErrorBoundary components for robust error handling
- TailwindCSS styling following established design system

### File Locations
**Based on existing project structure:**
- Enhanced chat components: `components/Chat/`
- AI service layer: `lib/ai/`
- Chat API routes: `app/api/chat/`
- Conversation management: `app/dashboard/conversations/`
- Types: `types/chat.ts`, `types/ai.ts`
- OpenAI service: `lib/openai.ts`
- Langroid orchestration: `lib/langroid.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS
- AI Integration: OpenAI + Langroid orchestration
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase for conversation persistence
- TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns using CVA and Radix UI

**AI Integration Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- OpenAI API integration with proper error handling and retries
- Langroid orchestration for complex conversation flows
- Educational prompt engineering for domain-specific responses
- Conversation context management for coherent multi-turn discussions
- Rate limiting and cost management for API calls

**Performance Considerations:** [Source: docs/PRD-didattika.md#requisiti-non-funzionali]
- AI response time target < 3 seconds
- Optimized prompt engineering for faster responses
- Conversation context caching for improved performance
- Progressive loading for conversation history
- Efficient database queries for message retrieval

**Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
- Secure OpenAI API key management (server-side only)
- Rate limiting on chat endpoints to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization and validation for user messages
- User authentication verification for all chat endpoints
- GDPR compliance for conversation data storage and management
