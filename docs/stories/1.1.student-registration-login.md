# Story 1.1: Student Registration and Login ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** student,
**I want** to be able to register and log in to the platform,
**so that** I can start using the AI learning assistant and access my personalized experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Student can create a new account with email and password
2. Student can log in using their credentials
3. Student receives proper feedback for successful/failed authentication attempts
4. Student profile is created upon successful registration
5. Student is redirected to the appropriate dashboard after login
6. Basic form validation is in place for registration and login forms

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for authentication flow using Playwright
- Test coverage should include form validation, API error handling, and state management
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story insights available - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
**User Profile Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Users table in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, email, password_hash, user_type (student/teacher), created_at, updated_at
- Managed through Supabase authentication system

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- POST /auth/register - User registration
- POST /auth/login - User login  
- POST /auth/logout - User logout
- GET /auth/me - Get current user profile
- Uses JWT tokens for session management
- Supabase Auth integration for authentication flow

### Component Specifications
**UI Components Required:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- Registration form component with email/password fields
- Login form component with email/password fields
- Authentication provider component for state management
- Protected route wrapper component
- Error/success message components
- Form validation using React Hook Form or similar
- TailwindCSS styling following existing design system

### File Locations
**Based on project structure:**
- Authentication components: `components/Auth/`
- Authentication context: `components/Auth/AuthProvider.tsx` 
- Login page: `app/login/page.tsx`
- Register page: `app/register/page.tsx`
- Authentication API routes: `app/api/auth/`
- Types: `types/auth.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS
- Authentication: Supabase Auth
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns using CVA and Radix UI where applicable

**Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
- JWT token security
- Password validation and hashing
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Input sanitization and validation
