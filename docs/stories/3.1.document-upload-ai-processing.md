# Story 3.1: Document Upload and AI Processing ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to upload PDF files or study notes and receive AI-powered support based on the content,
**so that** I can get contextual help and explanations related to my specific learning materials.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can upload PDF, TXT, and DOCX files through a drag-and-drop interface
2. System validates file types, sizes, and content before processing
3. AI processes uploaded documents and extracts key content for context
4. User can ask questions about uploaded documents and receive relevant AI responses
5. Document content is integrated with AI chat to provide contextual answers
6. Upload progress is displayed with clear feedback to the user
7. Error handling for unsupported files, processing failures, and size limits
8. Document content is securely stored and associated with the user account
9. AI responses reference specific parts of uploaded documents when relevant

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for complete document upload and AI processing flow using Playwright
- Test document processing with sample PDF, TXT, and DOCX files
- Test coverage should include file validation, processing, and AI integration
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.2 (Teacher Material Upload and Access):**
- File upload component patterns are established
- Supabase Storage integration is implemented
- File validation and metadata management are available

**From Story 2.1 & 2.2 (AI Chat System):**
- AI service layer with OpenAI and Langroid integration is established
- Conversation context management is implemented
- Multi-persona AI system is available for contextual responses

### Data Models
**Document Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Documents table in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, user_id, title, file_path, file_type, file_size, content_text, metadata, created_at, updated_at
- Integration with existing Users table
- Content indexing for AI search and context

**Document-Conversation Relationship:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- DocumentConversations table for linking documents to chat sessions
- Fields: id, document_id, conversation_id, context_relevance, created_at
- Many-to-many relationship between documents and conversations

### API Specifications
**Document Upload Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- POST /api/documents/upload - Handle file upload and initial processing
- GET /api/documents - List user's uploaded documents with metadata
- GET /api/documents/:id - Get specific document details and content
- DELETE /api/documents/:id - Remove document and associated data
- POST /api/documents/:id/process - Trigger document reprocessing

**Document Processing Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- POST /api/documents/:id/extract - Extract and process document content
- GET /api/documents/:id/summary - Get AI-generated document summary
- POST /api/chat/ask-document - Ask questions about specific documents

### Component Specifications
**Document UI Components:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- DocumentUpload component with drag-and-drop functionality
- DocumentList component for displaying uploaded documents
- DocumentPreview component for viewing document content
- DocumentChat component for document-specific AI conversations
- UploadProgress component with detailed status indicators
- DocumentManager component for organization and management
- TailwindCSS styling following existing design system

### File Locations
**Based on existing project structure:**
- Document upload component: `components/DocumentUpload/` (existing structure observed)
- Document management: `components/Documents/`
- Document API routes: `app/api/documents/`
- Document processing services: `lib/documents/`
- PDF processing: `lib/documents/pdf-parser.ts`
- DOCX processing: `lib/documents/docx-parser.ts`
- Types: `types/documents.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS
- Storage: Supabase Storage for file management
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase for document metadata
- AI Integration: OpenAI + Langroid for document processing
- TypeScript for type safety with document interfaces

**Document Processing Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#storage-documenti]
- Supported formats: PDF, TXT, DOCX as specified in PRD
- PDF parsing using libraries like pdf-parse or PDF.js
- DOCX parsing using libraries like mammoth or docx
- Text preprocessing for AI context integration
- Content chunking for large documents

**File Storage Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#storage-documenti]
- Supabase Storage integration for secure file storage
- File access control and user isolation
- File size limits (recommend 10MB max for MVP)
- Virus scanning and security validation
- GDPR compliance for user document data

**Performance Considerations:** [Source: docs/PRD-didattika.md#requisiti-non-funzionali]
- Document processing should complete within reasonable time (<30s for typical documents)
- Asynchronous processing for large files with progress updates
- Efficient text extraction and content indexing
- Optimized storage and retrieval for document content

**Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
- File type validation and security scanning
- User document isolation and access control
- Secure file storage with proper permissions
- Content sanitization before AI processing
- GDPR compliance for document content storage
