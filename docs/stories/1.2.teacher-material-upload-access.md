# Story 1.2: Teacher Material Upload and Access ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** teacher,
**I want** to be able to upload educational materials and access a dedicated teacher workspace,

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for teacher workflow using Playwright
- Test coverage should include file upload, permission management, and analytics
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1 (Student Registration and Login):**
- Authentication infrastructure with Supabase is established
- User registration and login flows are implemented
- AuthProvider context pattern is available for state management
- Protected route wrapper components are available
- Form validation patterns using React Hook Form are established

### Data Models
**User Profile Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Users table in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, email, password_hash, user_type (student/teacher), created_at, updated_at
- Extension needed for teacher-specific metadata and permissions
- Managed through Supabase authentication system

**Materials Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- New materials table required in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, teacher_id, title, description, file_path, file_type, subject, visibility, created_at, updated_at
- Integration with Users table via foreign key relationship

**Analytics Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Material interactions tracking table
- Fields: id, material_id, student_id, interaction_type, timestamp, duration
- Aggregation support for teacher analytics dashboard

### API Specifications
**Teacher Authentication Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- POST /auth/register/teacher - Teacher registration with role validation
- Extension of existing authentication endpoints from Story 1.1
- Role-based JWT token claims for teacher permissions

**Material Management Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- POST /api/materials - Upload and create new material
- GET /api/materials - List teacher's materials with filtering
- PUT /api/materials/:id - Update material metadata and permissions
- DELETE /api/materials/:id - Remove material
- GET /api/materials/:id/analytics - Get material usage analytics

**File Upload Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#storage]
- POST /api/upload - Handle file upload to Supabase Storage
- File validation and processing pipeline
- Integration with material metadata creation

### Component Specifications
**UI Components Required:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- Teacher dashboard layout component
- Material upload component with drag-and-drop functionality
- Material list and grid view components
- Analytics dashboard components with charts
- Permission management interface components
- Course/subject organization components
- TailwindCSS styling following existing design system
- Integration with existing authentication components

### File Locations
**Based on project structure:**
- Teacher dashboard: `app/teacher/page.tsx`
- Material management: `app/teacher/materials/page.tsx`
- Teacher components: `components/Teacher/`
- Material upload component: `components/Teacher/MaterialUpload.tsx`
- Teacher dashboard components: `components/Teacher/TeacherDashboard.tsx`
- Analytics components: `components/Teacher/Analytics.tsx`
- Material management API: `app/api/materials/`
- File upload API: `app/api/upload/`
- Types: `types/teacher.ts`, `types/materials.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with role-based access control
- Storage: Supabase Storage for file management
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase
