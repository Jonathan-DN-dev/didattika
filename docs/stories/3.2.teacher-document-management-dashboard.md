## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for teacher document management workflow using Playwright
- Test privacy controls and access permissions for teacher-student relationships
- Test coverage should include filtering, analytics, and approval workflows
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.2 (Teacher Material Upload and Access):**
- Teacher authentication and role-based access control is established
- Teacher dashboard layout and navigation patterns are available
- Analytics infrastructure for teacher features is implemented

**From Story 3.1 (Document Upload and AI Processing):**
- Document storage and processing infrastructure is established
