# Story 5.1: Conversation History and Session Management ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to save, retrieve, and manage my previous conversations with the AI,
**so that** I can continue learning sessions, review past discussions, and build upon previous knowledge.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can save current AI conversations for future reference
2. User can view a list of all previous conversations with metadata (date, topic, AI persona)
3. User can resume conversations from where they left off
4. User can search through conversation history by content or keywords
5. User can organize conversations with custom titles and categories
6. User can delete conversations they no longer need
7. Conversation context is preserved when resuming sessions
8. User can export conversation transcripts for study purposes
9. System automatically saves conversations and handles session management

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for complete conversation lifecycle using Playwright
- Test conversation persistence, search, and resumption functionality
- Test coverage should include data integrity, search accuracy, and export features
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 2.1 & 2.2 (AI Chat System):**
- AI conversation management infrastructure is established
- Multi-persona chat system is available for context preservation
- Conversation state management patterns are implemented

**From Story 3.1 (Document Upload and AI Processing):**
- Document-conversation linking is available for contextual sessions
- Content processing and storage patterns can be applied to conversations

### Data Models
**Enhanced Conversation Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Conversations table with comprehensive metadata
- Fields: id, user_id, title, description, persona_type, status, document_ids, created_at, updated_at, last_accessed
- Enhanced with user organization and categorization

**Conversation Sessions Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- ConversationSessions table for tracking active and resumed sessions
- Fields: id, conversation_id, session_start, session_end, context_snapshot, resumption_count
- Session management and context preservation

**Conversation Tags Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- ConversationTags table for user organization
- Fields: id, conversation_id, tag_name, tag_type, user_created, created_at
- User-defined and AI-suggested conversation categorization

### API Specifications
**Conversation Management Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- GET /api/conversations - List user's conversations with metadata and filtering
- GET /api/conversations/:id - Get specific conversation with full history
- PUT /api/conversations/:id - Update conversation metadata (title, tags)
- DELETE /api/conversations/:id - Delete conversation with confirmation
- POST /api/conversations/:id/resume - Resume conversation with context restoration

**Conversation Search and Organization:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- GET /api/conversations/search - Search conversations by content and metadata
- POST /api/conversations/:id/tag - Add tags to conversation for organization
- GET /api/conversations/categories - Get user's conversation categories and tags
- POST /api/conversations/export - Export conversation data in various formats

### Component Specifications
**Conversation Management Components:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- ConversationHistory component for listing and organizing conversations
- ConversationSearch component with advanced filtering capabilities
- ConversationPreview component for quick content overview
- ConversationManager component for bulk operations and organization
- ConversationExport component for generating study materials
- SessionManager component for handling conversation resumption
- TailwindCSS styling following existing dashboard design patterns

### File Locations
**Based on existing project structure:**
- Conversation history components: `components/Chat/History/`
- Conversation management: `components/Chat/ConversationManager.tsx`
- History API routes: `app/api/conversations/`
- Session management: `lib/sessions/`
- Export utilities: `lib/export/`
- Types: `types/conversation-history.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]

- Optimized conversation loading with pagination and lazy loading
- Context preservation without performance degradation

**Data Management Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Conversation data integrity and consistency
- Efficient indexing for search and filtering operations
- Backup and recovery for conversation history
- Data retention policies for long-term storage

**Privacy and Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
