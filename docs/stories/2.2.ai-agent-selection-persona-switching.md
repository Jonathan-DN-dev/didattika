# Story 2.2: AI Agent Selection and Persona Switching ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to choose whether to speak with a tutor, coach, or teacher AI persona,
**so that** I can receive specialized assistance tailored to my specific learning needs and context.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can select from three AI agent personas: Tutor, Teacher, and Coach
2. Each AI persona has distinct conversational styles and educational approaches
3. User can switch between personas during a conversation or start new conversations with different personas
4. AI responses reflect the selected persona's characteristics and expertise
5. Interface clearly indicates which persona is currently active
6. Persona selection is persistent within a conversation but can be changed
7. Each persona has appropriate prompt engineering for their specific role
8. User can understand the differences between personas through UI guidance

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for persona switching and conversation continuity using Playwright
- Test persona-specific AI responses with mocked OpenAI responses
- Test coverage should include persona selection, switching, and context preservation
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 2.1 (Multi-agent AI Chat Interface):**
- Enhanced chat interface components are available
- OpenAI API integration with Langroid orchestration is established
- Conversation management and context persistence are implemented
- AI service layer and error handling patterns are available

**From Previous Stories (1.1, 1.2, 1.3):**

- Component patterns using CVA and Radix UI are established

### Data Models
**Enhanced Conversation Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Conversazioni table with persona field
- Fields: id, user_id, persona_type, title, context, created_at, updated_at
- persona_type enum: 'tutor', 'teacher', 'coach'
- Integration with existing conversation management

**Persona Configuration Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Persona configurations table for system settings
- Fields: id, persona_type, prompt_template, behavior_config, created_at, updated_at
- Centralized persona definition management

### API Specifications
**Persona Management Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- GET /api/personas - List available AI personas with descriptions
- POST /api/chat/conversations - Create conversation with specific persona
- PUT /api/chat/conversations/:id/persona - Switch persona for existing conversation
- GET /api/personas/:type/prompts - Get persona-specific prompt templates

**Enhanced Chat Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- POST /api/chat/message - Send message with persona context
- Persona-aware response generation using specialized prompts
- Context preservation during persona switches

### Component Specifications
**Persona UI Components:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- PersonaSelector component with visual persona cards
- PersonaIndicator component for showing active persona
- PersonaSwitcher component for mid-conversation changes
- PersonaInfo component with descriptions and use cases
- Enhanced ChatInterface with persona-aware features

### File Locations
**Based on existing project structure:**
- Persona components: `components/Chat/Personas/`
- Persona selector: `components/Chat/Personas/PersonaSelector.tsx`
- Persona indicator: `components/Chat/Personas/PersonaIndicator.tsx`
- Enhanced AI service: `lib/ai/personas.ts`
- Persona API routes: `app/api/personas/`
- Persona types: `types/personas.ts`
- Persona configurations: `lib/ai/persona-configs.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS
- AI Integration: OpenAI + Langroid orchestration with persona support
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase for persona and conversation storage
- TypeScript for type safety with persona enum definitions
- Follow existing component patterns using CVA and Radix UI

**AI Persona Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- Tutor Persona: Patient, explanatory, step-by-step guidance focused
- Teacher Persona: Authoritative, comprehensive, curriculum-focused responses
- Coach Persona: Motivational, goal-oriented, progress-tracking approach
- Persona-specific prompt engineering for distinct conversational styles
- Context-aware responses that maintain persona consistency

**Persona Definitions:** [Source: docs/didattika-operativo.md#epic-2]
- **Tutor**: Focuses on individual learning, patient explanations, personalized help
- **Teacher**: Provides structured curriculum-based responses, formal educational content
- **Coach**: Emphasizes motivation, goal-setting, progress tracking, and encouragement

**Performance Considerations:** [Source: docs/PRD-didattika.md#requisiti-non-funzionali]
- Persona switching should be seamless without conversation interruption
- Persona-specific prompt loading should be optimized for quick responses
- UI transitions between personas should be smooth and intuitive
- Context preservation during persona switches should be efficient

**Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
- Persona prompt templates stored securely on server-side
- User persona preferences stored with proper data privacy
- Input validation for persona selection and switching
- Rate limiting considerations for persona-specific API calls
