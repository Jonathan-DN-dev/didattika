# Story 1.2: Basic AI Chat Interface ✅

## Status
Completed ✅

## Story
**As a** student,
**I want** to be able to chat with an AI assistant after logging in,
**so that** I can get help with my studies and have a conversational learning experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Student can access a chat interface after successful login
2. Student can send text messages to the AI assistant
3. AI assistant responds with contextual, helpful messages using OpenAI API
4. Chat conversation displays in a clean, readable format
5. Chat interface shows typing indicators and loading states
6. Basic error handling for API failures and network issues
7. Chat maintains conversation context within the session
8. Student can start a new conversation or continue existing one

## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for chat flow using Playwright
- Mock OpenAI API calls for consistent testing
- Test coverage should include message sending, receiving, error states, and loading states
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.1 (Student Registration and Login):**
- Authentication infrastructure is in place with Supabase
- User context and protected routes are available
- TailwindCSS design system established
- Component patterns using CVA and Radix UI are established

### Data Models
**Chat/Conversation Schema:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#database]
- Conversazioni table in PostgreSQL database
- Fields: id, user_id, created_at, updated_at, title, context
- Message storage for conversation history
- Integration with existing Users table from authentication

### API Specifications
**AI Chat Endpoints:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#backend-api]
- POST /api/chat - Send message to AI and get response
- GET /api/chat/history - Retrieve chat history for authenticated user
- POST /api/chat/new - Start new conversation
- Uses JWT tokens from existing auth system for user identification
- OpenAI API integration for AI responses

**OpenAI Integration:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- Provider: OpenAI (GPT-4 / GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Orchestration: Langroid or Langchain for conversation management
- Multi-persona prompts (tutor, docente, coach)
- Contextual responses based on educational domain

### Component Specifications
**UI Components Required:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#frontend-web]
- Chat interface container component
- Message bubble components (user and AI)
- Chat input component with send button
- Typing indicator component
- Chat provider component for state management
- Error handling and loading state components
- TailwindCSS styling following existing design system
- Integration with existing authentication components

### File Locations
**Based on project structure:**
- Chat components: `components/Chat/`
- Chat interface: `components/Chat/ChatInterface.tsx`
- Chat provider: `components/Chat/ChatProvider.tsx`
- Chat page: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` or dedicated chat route
- Chat API routes: `app/api/chat/`
- Types: `types/chat.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#stack-tecnologico-riassuntivo]
- Frontend: Next.js with App Router + TailwindCSS
- AI Integration: OpenAI + Langroid orchestration
- Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase for conversation storage
- TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns using CVA and Radix UI where applicable

**AI Specific Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#modulo-ai]
- OpenAI API integration with proper error handling
- Rate limiting on AI API calls to manage costs
- Conversation context management for coherent responses
- Educational-focused prompt engineering
- Response time optimization (target < 3s per PRD requirements)

**Security Considerations:** [Source: docs/architecture-didattika.md#sicurezza]
- API key protection for OpenAI calls (server-side only)
- Rate limiting on chat endpoints to prevent abuse
- Input sanitization for user messages
- Authentication verification for all chat endpoints
- GDPR compliance for conversation data storage
