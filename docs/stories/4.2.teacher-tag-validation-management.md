## Dev Notes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests should be created using Jest + React Testing Library
- Test files should be placed alongside components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Integration tests for teacher tag management workflow using Playwright
- Test tag validation, bulk operations, and AI feedback loops
- Test coverage should include permissions, analytics, and export functionality
- Follow existing testing patterns in `components/` directory
